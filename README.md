<h1>What is Collaborative Filtering</h1>
Collaborative filtering is the predictive process behind recommendation engines. Recommendation engines analyze information about users with similar tastes to assess the probability that a target individual will enjoy something.

Collaborative filtering uses algorithms to filter data from user reviews to make personalized recommendations for users with similar preferences. Collaborative filtering is also used to select content and advertising for individuals on social media.
Collaborative filtering filters information by using the interactions and data collected by the system from other users. For example when we want to find a new movie to watch we'll often ask our friends for recommendations.

Naturally, we have greater trust in the recommendations from friends who share tastes similar to our own. Collaborative filtering does the same job. Collaborative filtering mostly focuses on finding similarity between users and recommend each other their likes. There are various ways to find the similarity measure : Cosine similarity, Pearson similarity, Jaccard similarity etc.
